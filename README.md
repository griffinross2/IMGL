# IMGL
IMGL (combination of immediate-mode and OpenGL) is a basic immediate-mode GUI framework I am working on as an educational/fun project.

This project is my first foray into rendering a GUI, immediate-mode architecture (I've always used Qt previously), or just making a somewhat
serious C++ library project in the first place. I am also an Electrical Engineer, so I don't interact with C++ all of the time, and there
will potentially be some coding sins committed here.

IMGL is meant to be very lightweight, and more work will have to be done to build features that are needed for a complete GUI program.
I will hopefully build out the examples with some higher-level things built on top of IMGL (e.g text input box).
